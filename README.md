MEAN todo
=========

Basic todo app using the MEAN stack.

##Getting set up
To run this app, you will need [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org) and [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) installed locally.
If you are using a Mac, the preferred way to install Node is using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). I've never tried installing on Windows, but NodeJS's website has instructions.

Once you have these installed, the last step is to clone this repo.

##Running the app
Now for the easy part. `cd` into the directory where you cloned this and run `node index.js`. In your browser, go to `//localhost:3000`
